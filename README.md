# Academic Performance Toolkit - Grade Genius

## Overview

This project contains tools to aid students in managing and analyzing their academic performance. The toolkit includes:

- **CPI Calculator:** Predict your Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) by inputting Semester Performance Indices (SPIs) and semester credits for all relevant semesters.
  
- **SPI Calculator:** Simplify the calculation of Semester Performance Indices (SPIs) based on your grades. It offers two calculators: one customized for IIT Goa students and another generic calculator suitable for students from any college.
  
- **SPI Predictor:** Determine the Semester Performance Index (SPI) required for a specific semester to achieve your desired Cumulative Performance Index (CPI).
  
- **Marksheet Generator:** Generate a basic semester report or marksheet based on your grades for a particular semester.

These tools aim to streamline academic planning, goal setting, and performance tracking.

## Features

### CPI Calculator

Predict your Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) by inputting Semester Performance Indices (SPIs) and semester credits for all relevant semesters. This tool aids in academic planning and goal setting.

### SPI Calculator

Simplify the calculation of Semester Performance Indices (SPIs) based on your grades. It offers two calculators: one customized for IIT Goa students and another generic calculator suitable for students from any college. This tool streamlines the process of SPI calculation, providing accurate insights into academic performance.

### SPI Predictor

Determine the Semester Performance Index (SPI) required for a specific semester to achieve your desired Cumulative Performance Index (CPI). This feature helps students set realistic academic goals and understand the academic performance needed in upcoming semesters to meet those goals.

### Marksheet Generator

Generate a basic semester report or marksheet based on your grades for a particular semester. This functionality provides a convenient way to visualize and share academic progress, aiding in communication with instructors or advisors regarding academic performance.
